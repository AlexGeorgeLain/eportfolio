										<tr>
											<th>Question</th>
											<th>Comments</th>

											<td>3.5</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>2</td>
											<td>You used both while and if clause to solve the problem which is good. You used correct data types. Testing shows the result as expected. </td>

										<tr>
											<td>3</td>
											<td>Good use of len and indexing. ‘For’ loop makes the code efficient. Test data are demonstrated correctly.</td>
											<td>4</td>

										<tr>
											<td>4</td>
											<td>Constructs are correct, you used count to solve the problem. You may try using index positions as an alternative approach.</td>

											<td>5</td>
											<td>Len_max logic was good and implemented correctly. You showed the results and messages are clear.</td>

											<td>Overall Comments</td>
											<td>Overall excellent work. Comments are added. I think you can add commentary to demonstrate your thought process and showing alternative approaches can be added.</td>

									<h3 class="major">End of Module Assignment</h3>
									<p>This is a final module essay assessment to examine your awareness of current affairs, challenges, technological developments, trends and issues in relation to recent development in computer science. The essay fulfils the learning outcome where you are to critically appraise the emerging trends in the field of computer science, and the professional and ethical requirements for dealing with such contemporary computer-based technologies. For this task, you need to select an organisation as a case example for which secondary information is available through articles, webpages or you may have a contact working for this organisation. This was submitted at the end of Unit 12.</p>
